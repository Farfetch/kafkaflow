This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you want to prioritize certain types of messages over others, or when there is a need to control the rate of processing during high-load periods or when dealing with backlogs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/middlewares/middlewares":{"id":"guides/middlewares/middlewares","title":"Middleware Introduction","description":"In this section, we will learn what Middlewares are and how to create them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/middlewares/serializer-middleware":{"id":"guides/middlewares/serializer-middleware","title":"Serializer Middleware","description":"In this section, we will learn how to use the Serializer Middleware.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/middlewares/typed-handler-middleware":{"id":"guides/middlewares/typed-handler-middleware","title":"Typed Handler Middleware","description":"In this section, we will learn how to use the Typed Handler middleware.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/open-telemetry":{"id":"guides/open-telemetry","title":"OpenTelemetry instrumentation","description":"KafkaFlow includes support for Traces and Baggage signals using OpenTelemetry instrumentation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/producers":{"id":"guides/producers","title":"Producers","description":"In this section, we will learn how to add and configure a Producer on KafkaFlow.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction":{"id":"introduction","title":"Introduction to KafkaFlow","description":"KafkaFlow is a .NET framework to create Kafka-based applications, simple to use and extend.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
